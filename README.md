# The 3 Body Problem

### Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classical 3-body problem, a famous problem in celestial mechanics that models the motion of three massive bodies interacting under Newtonian gravity.

While the full mathematical formulation of the problemâ€”including the derivation of the governing equations and dimensional analysisâ€”can be quite detailed, all of that has been explained interactively in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook:

ðŸ‘‰ **[main.ipynb](./main.ipynb)**

The notebook provides:

* A clear breakdown of the physical assumptions.
* Derivation of the second-order and first-order ODE systems.
* Visualization of the orbits.
* An explanation of the dimensionless formulation for improved numerical stability.

### Contents

* `main.ipynb`: Main notebook with math, theory, and code.
* `main.py` (if applicable): ODE solver implementation.
* `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
